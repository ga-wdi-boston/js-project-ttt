A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

The data structure you plan to use.

I plan to use the api json structure to store my objects.  I will use the
store feature as covered in class to persist any data like the token.

How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

I will use lots of divs and css to format the page.  I may use some sass and
keep similar things together.

How you plan to approach this project.

I will build user stories, starting with those that allow me to get the
basic function going and build on that from there.

4-8 user stories for your game project.  I came up with 12 stories.

How you plan to keep your code modular.

Using the DRY practice I refactor code as I see a pattern of copy and paste appearing.

What creative spin will you add to your project?

If time permits, use some different graphics for the X and O

How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

I will checkin code often and commit code for each story that is worked.

Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

Not at this time.
